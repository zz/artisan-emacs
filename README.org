* My Emacs configuration
  I have re-organized my Emacs configuration. The directory structure
  is inspired by *bbatsov/prelude*. 

** core
   All files in this directory is the artisan-emacs core files,
   include basic ui settings, module settings, packages files.

** modules
   This folder stores all custom setting files for each plugin.

** vendors
   Third-party plugins which not existed in melpa package repository.
